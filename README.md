## MATH 579: Numerical Differential Equations final project


In this project, I numerically solved Einstein's equations to simulate the gravitational collapse of a dust cloud. 


EinsteinTensor.ipynb contains the symbolic code that calculates the Einstein tensor in terms of the metric tensor. 


Simulation.ipynb contains the numerical code.
